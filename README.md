# skillo

swap your skills

## Getting Started

"Skillo" is an app just for students in college and school. It helps them learn by trading skills with each other. Students make profiles showing what they're good at and when they can teach. They can easily plan sessions and swap skills. If a swap doesn't work out, students can offer things like food or trips. They can also ask for things like coffee, food, or trips in return for teaching. Reviews and ratings make sure the swaps are good. Skillo makes learning fun and easy for students to connect and learn from each other.
